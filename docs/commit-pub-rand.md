# Public Randomness Commit Specification

## Overview

The finality provider periodically commits public randomness to the consumer
chain to be used for future block finalization. This document specifies the
process of committing public randomness.

## Commit Process

### Generating a Commit

A randomness pair is essentially a pair of `32-byte` points over `secp256k1`.
A public randomness commit is a list of public
randomness, each committed to a specific height. In particular, a commit
consists of:

- a merkle root containing a list of public randomness values,
- a start height, indicating from which height the randomness starts, and
- the number of randomness contained in the merkle tree.

To generate a new commit, following steps are needed:

1. Generate a list of randomness. This requires an RPC call to the EOTS manager
  (eotsd) to generate a list of public randomness, each corresponding to a
  specific height according to the start height and the number of randomness in
  the request. Randomness generation is required to be deterministic.
2. Construct the merkle tree based on the list of randomness using the CometBFT's [merkle](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/crypto/merkle)
  library. The merkle root will be used in the commit, while each randomness
  number and their merkle proofs will be used for finality vote submission
  in the future.
3. Send a [Schnorr](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/blob/684d64ad74fed203fb846c032f2b55b3e3c36734/btcec/schnorr/signature.go#L391)
  signature request to the EOTS manager over the hash of the commit
  (concatenated by the start height, number of randomness, and the merkle root).
4. Build the commit message ([MsgCommitPubRandList](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/aa99e2eb093e06cb9a28a58f373e8fa5f2494383/proto/babylon/finality/v1/tx.proto#L29))
  and send a transaction to Babylon.

### Timing to Commit

Public randomness is an essential component of finality. It should be
committed before finality votes can be sent. Otherwise, the finality provider
looses voting power for this height.

To this end, when a finality provider is started, it runs a loop to periodically
check whether it needs to make a new commit and calculate the start height of
the next commit. In particular:

```go
	tipHeightWithDelay := tipHeight + uint64(fp.cfg.TimestampingDelayBlocks)
	var startHeight uint64
	switch {
	case lastCommittedHeight < tipHeightWithDelay:
		// the start height should consider the timestamping delay
		// as it is only available to use after tip height + estimated timestamping delay
		startHeight = tipHeightWithDelay
	case lastCommittedHeight < tipHeightWithDelay+uint64(fp.cfg.NumPubRand):
		startHeight = lastCommittedHeight + 1
	default:
        // randomness is sufficient, do not need to make a commit
```

where:

- `lastCommittedHeight` is the end height (`startHeight + numRand - 1`)
from the latest public randomness commit recorded on the consumer chain
- `tipHeight` is the current height of the consumer chain
- `TimestampingDelayBlocks` is a configuration value, which measures when to make a
  new commit
- `NumPubRand` is the number of randomness in a commit defined in the config.

### Determining TimestampingDelayBlocks

The value of `TimestampingDelayBlocks` must account for BTC-timestamping
delays, which is needed to activate the randomness for a specific height
after the committed epoch is BTC-timestamped. Here's an example:

- The consumer chain receives a commit with:
  - Start height: 100
  - Number of randomness values: 1000
  - Current epoch: 10
- This means randomness for heights [100, 1099] becomes available after epoch 10
  is finalized

The BTC-timestamping protocol requires:

- 100 BTC blocks for epoch finalization
- â‰ˆ 1000 minutes (17 hours) at 10-minute average block time
- With consumer chain blocks every 10 seconds, this equals approximately 6,000
  blocks

Therefore,

- `TimestampingDelayBlocks` should be around 6,000
- Recommended production value: > 10,000 to provide additional safety margin

### Determining Start Height

To determine the start height of a commit:

1. For first-time commit:
   - `startHeight = baseHeight + 1`,
   - where `baseHeight` is a future height which is estimated based on the
     BTC-timestamping delays.
2. For subsequent commit:
   - `startHeight = lastCommittedHeight + 1`,
   - where `lastCommittedHeight` is obtained from the consumer chain.

The `baseHeight` can be specified via configuration or CLI options.

**Important Notes:**

- After long downtime, treat as first-time commit by specifying `baseHeight`.
- Consecutiveness across commits is not enforced by the system but
  different commits must not overlap.
- `startHeight` should not be higher than `finalityActivationHeight`,
a parameter defined in Babylon. Therefore,
`startHeight = max(startHeight, finalityActivationHeight)`.

### Determining the Number of Randomness

The number of randomness contained in a commit is specified in the config
`NumPubRand`. A general strategy is that the value should be as large
as possible. This is because each commit to the consumer chain costs gas.
  
However, in real life, this stategy might not always gain due to the following
reasons:

- A finality provider might not have voting power for every block. Randomness
  for those heights is a waste.
- Generating more randomness leads to a larger merkle proof size which will be
  used for sending finality votes.
- Generating randomness and saving the merkle proofs require time.

Additionally, given that the end height of a commit equals to
`startHeight + NumPubRand - 1`, we should ensure that the condition
`lastCommittedHeight > tipHeight + uint64(TimestampingDelayBlocks)` can hold for
a long period of time to avoid frequent commit of randomness.
In real life, the value of `NumPubRand` should be much larger than
`TimestampingDelayBlocks`, e.g., `NumPubRand = 2 * TimestampingDelayBlocks`.
