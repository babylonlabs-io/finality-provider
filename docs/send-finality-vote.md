# Finality Votes Submission Specification

## Overview

Finality providers submit votes to finalize blocks on the consumer chain.
This document specifies the process of submitting finality votes.

## Internal State

The finality provider maintains two critical persistent states:

- Last voted height
- Last processed height

### Last voted height

Tracks the most recent height for which a finality vote was successfully
submitted. This prevents duplicate voting on previously voted heights.

### Last processed height

Tracks the most recent height for which a voting decision was made
(whether the decision was to vote or not).
By definition, `LastProcessedHeight >= LastVotedHeight` always holds.

## Submission Process

### Bootstrapping

To determine the initial processing height:

1. Query consumer chain for `lastFinalizedHeight` (`0` if no finalized blocks)
2. Query consumer chain for `finalityActivationHeight`:
3. Query `lastVotedHeightRemote` from consumer chain (`0` if no votes are sent)
4. Synchronize local state:
   - Ensure local `lastVotedHeight` and `lastProcessedHeight` â‰¥ `lastVotedHeightRemote`
5. Begin processing at:
   - `max(lastProcessedHeight + 1, lastFinalizedHeight + 1, finalityActivationHeight)`

### Normal Submission Loop

After the finality provider is bootstraped, it continuously monitors for
new blocks. For each new block, it performs these validation checks:

1. Block hasn't been previously processed
2. Block height exceeds finality activation height
3. Finality provider has sufficient voting power

Upon passing all checks, the finality provider:

1. Requests a finality signature from the EOTS manager
2. Submits the vote transaction to the consumer chain
3. Implements retry logic until either:
   - Maximum retry attempts are reached
   - Block becomes finalized

#### Batch submission

A batch submission mechanism is needed to deal with cases where:

- recovery from downtime, and
- the consumer chain has rapid block production.

Batch sumission puts multiple new blocks into a batch and
process them in the same loop, after which all the finality votes will be sent
in the same transaction to the consumer chain.

### Generating Finality Votes

To submit a finality vote, the finality provider needs to fill the
[MsgAddFinalitySig](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/e7ac8fdf888406b16727b9ffca1f2e48364e9f53/x/finality/types/tx.pb.go#L154):

1. Finality provider public key: the BTC PK of the finality provider that casts
   the vote in [BIP340 format](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/79615c6b057de041a9f4c1c4466ef212a0c678d6/types/btc_schnorr_pk.go#L14).
2. Block height: the height of the block that the vote is signed for.
3. Public randomness: the public randomness that is retrieved from the local,
   which is a [32-byte point](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/5f8af8ced17d24f3f0c6172293cd37fb3d055807/types/btc_schnorr_pub_rand.go#L12) over `secp256k1`.
4. Merkle proof: the merkle proof of the public randomness, which is generated
   when constructing the public randomness commit using the CometBFT's [merkle](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/crypto/merkle)
   library.
5. Block hash: the hash bytes of the block that the vote is signed.
6. Finality signature: the [EOTS signature](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/067082b9d3dd8dbe775d5ada70cd60151fe0f577/types/btc_schnorr_eots.go#L11)
   that is [signed](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/f19de7d0fcc4ea786a070a700a03d2cde3f57b7f/crypto/eots/eots.go#L54)
   by the finality provider's private key and the corresponding private randomness.

The consumer chain verifies:

- The finality provider has voting power for the given height
- Randomness was pre-committed and BTC-timestamped
- EOTS signature validity
